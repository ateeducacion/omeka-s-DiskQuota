Run this regression only in a disposable Omeka installation with DiskQuota active
and an administrator `admin@example.com`. It creates sites, items and uploaded
media and requires the real core API, database and HTTP upload handling.

CI runs it automatically on PHP 8.1 and SQLite in the `sqlite_integration` job
of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The job checks out the SQLite-capable Omeka fork
at `74a5e131f1881e9d565cf346ff090155b7ee833b`, installs its Composer dependencies
and uses Omeka CLI 0.18.0, verified against its published SHA256, to install Omeka
and activate this module. No production data or GitHub secrets are used.

To run the same job locally, prepare a clean checkout of that core revision
with `composer install --no-dev`, download the verified CLI PHAR, then run:

```sh
bash test/integration/run-sqlite.sh /path/to/disposable/omeka /path/to/omeka-s-cli.phar
```

The runner prints the four checks and fails on an HTTP error or missing
`AUDIT_RESULT=PASS`. The PHP server and temporary database/uploads are removed
on exit. Installed Omeka data remains in the disposable checkout.

For manual testing against an already installed disposable instance:

Inside the isolated container, with this repository mounted at `/module`:

```sh
cd /var/www/html
php -r 'file_put_contents("/tmp/full.txt", str_repeat("x", 1048576)); file_put_contents("/tmp/new.txt", str_repeat("x", 1024));'
DISKQUOTA_TEST_ROOT=/var/www/html php -S 127.0.0.1:8765 /module/test/integration/contradictory-item.php
```

In another shell in that container:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -F 'file[]=@/tmp/full.txt' -F 'file[]=@/tmp/new.txt' -F 'file[]=@/tmp/new.txt' http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Run once per clean SQLite/MariaDB database. Expect four `PASS` lines and
`AUDIT_RESULT=PASS`. The original PR commit `72de488` fails the first case. The
last case guards against querying stale site assignments when the explicit
`o:item` matches the parent currently being hydrated.
